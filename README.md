Start by cloning and then running 'npm install'

The dev environment for the app currently runs with two servers: 1. A Webpack development server and 2. a node server for API calls

I have set up the development environment so that you can run both using the command 'npm start' from the app root. Any changes to the server or application will be recompiled and updated upon file save.
