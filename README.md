TwitchAvid is a video streaming and chat app that focuses on gaming videos. TwitchAvid is an improvement upon the Twitch.tv website that is popular in the gaming community. Users can sign into their Twitch accounts, are able to search for videos by looking up their favorite games or gamers, and view up to 4 videos at a time. The main video is larger than the other 3 and this position can be switched with any of the 3 other videos. It has a chat function that is triggered when clicking on a specific video so that the user can communicate with the gaming community.
